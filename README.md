Create  a method that takes an int called x and returns its reversed version as int. 
 - Your method should work with both positive and negative values.
 - Additionally, if reversing a number creates a value that does not fit into an int and causes an integer overflow,   your method should return 0 instead.
   Integer overflow happens when you try to fit into integer variable a value that is more than the Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) or the opposite. Ex: 2147483647 + 1  ->  -2147483648 
 - You can use any approach to reverse (modulo and division, String, StringBuilder, etc)
